"""Assignment 5 â€” User-defined functions (no external modules)

This file provides a simple pure-Python implementation of a function that
finds song titles that are exactly a specified character length, or, if
none match exactly, the title(s) whose lengths are closest to the target.

No imports or external libraries are used.
